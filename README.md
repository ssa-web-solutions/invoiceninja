## Introduction

Version 5 of Invoice Ninja is here! We've taken the best parts of version 4 and bolted on all of the most requested features to produce a invoicing application like no other. 

All Pro and Enterprise features from the hosted app are included in the open-code. We offer a $30 per year white-label license to remove the Invoice Ninja branding from client facing parts of the app.
